                        2011, and my last serious upgrade was in 2015. I guess that's yet
                        another sign that <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-pc-is-over/">the PC is over</a>,
                        because PC upgrades have gotten <em>really boring</em>. It took 5 years for me to muster up the
                        initiative to get my system fully upgraded! 🥱</p>

                    <p>I
                        chose the Streacom DA2 as my personal build, because after
                        experimenting heavily with the DAN A4 SFX, I realized you need more room
                        to deal with extremely powerful CPUs and GPUs in this form factor, and I
                        wanted a truly powerful system:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-9900ks.html">i9-9900KS</a>

                    <p>Compared
                        to my old 2015-2017 system, a slightly overclocked i7-7700k, that at
                        least gives me 2× the cores (and faster cores, both in clock rate and
                        IPC), 2× the memory, and 2× the M.2 slots (two versus one).</p>

                    <p>The
                        DA2 is a clever case though less perfect than the A4-SFX. What's neat
                        about it is the hybrid open-air design (on the top and bottom) plus the
                        versatile horizontal and vertical bracket system interior. Per <a href="https://streacom.com/downloads/ug/da2-user-guide-180901.pdf">the manual (pdf)</a>:</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="index_files/streacom-da2-overview.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
                    <p>Check out all the bracket mounting options. Incredibly versatile, and easy to manipulate with the
                        captured nut and bolt design:</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="index_files/streacom-da2-bracket-options.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
                    <p>Note that you can (and really <em>should</em>) pop out the top and bottom acrylic pieces with the
                        mesh dust net.</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="index_files/streacom-da2-dust-nets.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
                    <p>I had <strong>dramatically better temperatures</strong>
                        after I did this, and it also made the build easier since the case can
                        fully "breathe" through the top and bottom. You'll note that the front
                        of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra
                        airflow.</p>
                    <p>I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The
                            side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit
                            makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?</li>
                        <li>(Don't
                            even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is
                            supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power
                            supply, which you'd expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)</li>
                        <li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>. I
                            had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable
                            upwards so it blocks less stuff.</li>
                        <li>Less
                            of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a
                            powerful GPU and CPU, you'll need two case fans. There's mounting points
                            for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to
                            mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here's the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with
                        three fans total:</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="index_files/streacom-da2-fan-config.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure>
                    <p>If
                        you are a water cooling kind of person – I am definitely not, I
                        experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early
                        2000s – then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.</p>
                    <p>I have definitely <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/">burn-in tested
                            this machine</a>,
                        as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to
                        be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended
                        periods of time you <em>might</em> need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints.
                        (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)</p>
                    <p>If
                        you haven't built a PC system recently, it's easier than it has ever
                        been. Heck by the time you install the M.2 drives, memory, CPU, and
                        cooler on the motherboard you're <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/drvb47/your_scientists_were_so_preoccupied_with_whether/">almost

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
                    <p>In an electric car, the (enormous) battery is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-12/electric-vehicle-battery-shrinks-and-so-does-the-total-cost">a
                            major part of the price</a>. If electric car prices are decreasing, battery costs
                        <em>must</em>
                        be decreasing, because it's not like the cost of fabricating rubber,
                        aluminum, glass, and steel into car shapes can decline that much, right?</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/ev-battery-costs.png" alt="ev-battery-costs"></p>
                    <p>On an <em>electric scooter</em>, though, the effect of battery price has to be even more dramatic
                        because scooters are such <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/geek-transportation-systems/">lightweight, compact, and
                            simple machines</a>. They aren't much more than a battery and an electric motor to begin
                        with. Remember the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Sebastopol-s-Zap-Power-Systems-is-banking-on-3067718.php">the
                            Zappy electric scooter</a> from twenty years ago?</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/zappy-electric-scooter-year-2000.jpg" alt="zappy-electric-scooter-year-2000"></p>
                    <p>What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/">killed the
                            electric car</a>
                        of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It's too heavy, it
                        lacks power, it doesn't have enough range, it takes too long to charge.
                        These are all different ways of saying the same thing: <em>the battery sucks</em>. It wasn't
                        until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter — and
                        pretty much electric <em>everything</em>, if you think about it — became viable.</p>
                    <p>Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed
                        generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to
                        examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let's
                        consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:</p>
                    <p><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/Xiaomi-Electric-Long-range-Fold-n-Carry-Ultra-Lightweight/product/B076KKX4BC"><img src="index_files/xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019.png" alt="xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019"></a></p>
                    <p>This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it
                        looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US
                        market in early 2017 was around $800. So <strong>the price of a popular, common electric scooter
                            has <em>halved</em> in three years.</strong> Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of
                        all types!</p>
                    <p>This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may
                        not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric
                        scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time
                        period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime.jpg" alt="electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime"></p>
                    <p>Early versions of Bird scooters were <em>actual Xiaomi M365s</em>, slightly modified for rental.
                        Only by late 2018 had they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles">migrated to</a> custom built,
                        ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html">have
                            their own challenges</a>, and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather
                        than the classic 15 cents per minute.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In
                            early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles,
                            which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs
                            in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of
                            gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with
                            locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.</p>
                        <p>In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental
                            program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per
                            month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per
                            ride.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>But this isn't meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business
                        models.</p>
                    <p>I want to tackle a more fundamental question: <strong>are electric scooters the future of
                            transportation?</strong></p>
                    <p>Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of

                    <p>We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I
                        enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an
                        electric scooter. So I bought one. It is of course the popular,
                        inexpensive, and well reviewed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076KKX4BC/?tag=codihorr-20">Xiaomi Mi M365</a>.</p>

                            and if you can get it for a price around $300, practically a no-brainer.</strong> I love it,
                        my kids love it, and as long as you're <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/2/18053650/elon-musk-electric-scooters-dignity-recode-swisher">conceptually
                            OK with the look, unlike Elon Musk</a> 🛴💨 then you'll probably love it too.</p>
                    <p>I found a neat video covering the "one year later" experience of
                        owning the scooter, and what you might eventually run into or want to
                        tweak.</p>
                    <p>(The main thing to take away from this video is that flats <em>super suck</em>
                        on tires this small, so be warned. I put Slime in my Mi's tires out of
                        an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires
                        – at the cost of some ride comfort – if you're really worried.)</p>
                    <p>That's not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect.
                        There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the
                        biggest one: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live">your
                            local government has no idea how to regulate the darn things</a>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?</li>
                        <li>Are they allowed on the sidewalk?</li>
                        <li>Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars … uh, depending on the speed limit?</li>
                        <li>Do you need a driver's license?</li>
                        <li>Do you need a helmet?</li>
                        <li>Are you even <em>allowed</em> to legally ride them in public at all outside of private
                            property?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent
                        logic. Here are <a href="https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/">the current
                            electric scooter laws in California</a>, for what it's worth, which <em>require the rider to
                            have a valid driver's license</em>
                        (unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both
                        of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.</p>
                    <p>One aspect of those laws I <em>definitely</em> agree with, however, is the <strong>15 mile per
                            hour speed restriction</strong>.
                        That's a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special
                        safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly …
                        uncomfortable. Consider <a href="https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/">this
                            monster of a 1165KWh electric scooter</a>, with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up
                        to <em>forty freakin' miles per hour</em>.</p>
                    <p>That … is … terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety
                        gear, wasn't willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don't blame
                        him! But now that I've shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman
                        budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a
                        taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic
                        electric vehicles. If you want a <a href="https://www.unagiscooters.com/products/the-scooter?variant=15012683448435">luxury</a>
                        electric scooter, an <a href="https://fluidfreeride.com/products/mosquito-lightweight-foldable-electric-scooter">ultralight</a>
                        electric scooter, a <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/06/10/widewheel-electric-scooter-off-road-test/">rugged
                            offroad</a> electric scooter … all things are possible, for a price.</p>
                    <p>Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor, the <a href="https://www.mi.com/global/mi-electric-scooter-pro/">Xiaomi M365 Pro</a>, was recently
                        released, although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment.</p>
                    <p>Having ridden my M365 a fair bit, I can confirm all the Pro
                        improvements are welcome, if incremental: bigger battery and disc brake,
                        more power, better display, improved latch mechanism, etc.</p>
                    <p>None of those Pro improvements, however, are worth a 2× increase in
                        price so I'd recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value
                        proposition is off the charts. Did I mention there's a bluetooth
                        connection, and an app, and it is possible to <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/blog/how-to/how-to-install-xiaomi-m365-electric-scooter-firmware-mod-6635">hack
                            the M365 firmware</a>? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn't it?
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Please be respectful around pedestrians.</strong> Most of the
                                sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I
                                encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out
                                than I’ve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards)
                                on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more
                                heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour
                                speed it can reach – but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how
                                people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed
                                when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available,
                                I'd definitely recommend using that.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Hills work great.</strong> The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills,
                                and I'm pleased to report that even with a <small>cough</small> sizable adult such as
                                myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most
                                <em>reasonable</em> hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought "this probably should
                                work", it did. That's impressive, considering this <em>isn't</em>
                                the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On
                                flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you'd expect. That
                                said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly
                                hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Portability is good, but borderline.</strong> At ~26 pounds,
                                the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it's not something you
                                a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with
                                you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for
                                any significant length of time. It's not nearly as nimble or portable
                                as a kick scooter, but that's a high bar. You'll need to carry a bike
                                lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which
                                turned out to be … more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due
                                to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel.
                                They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To be honest with you I'm still bitter about the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc.">Segway</a> debacle. There was so much hype
                        back in the day. That ridiculous thing was <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/">supposed to change the world</a>.
                        Instead, we got … <em>Paul Blart Mall Cop</em>.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/paul-blart-segway.jpeg" alt="paul-blart-segway"></p>
                    <p>A Segway was $5,000 at launch in 2001, which is a whopping $7,248 in
                        inflation adjusted dollars. Here in 2019, cheap $200 to $300 electric
                        scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was <em>supposed</em>
                        to be, aren't they? Are electric scooters the future of (most)
                        transportation? I'm not sure, but I do like where we're headed, even if
                        it took us twenty years to get there.</p>

                    <p>I've never thought of myself as a "car person". The last new car I bought (and in fact, now that
                        I think about it, the <em>first</em> new car I ever bought) was the <a href="https://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/articles/2018/04/12/cult-of-the-ford-svt-contour">quirky
                            1998 Ford Contour SVT</a>.
                        Since then we bought a VW station wagon in 2011 and a Honda minivan in
                        2012 for family transportation duties. That's it. Not exactly the stuff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stig">The Stig's</a> dreams are made of.</p>
                    <p>The station wagon made sense for a family of three, but became
                        something of a disappointment because it was purchased before —
                        surprise! — <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/">we had twins</a>. As <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/twain/3274/">Mark Twain once said</a>:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you are in your right
                            mind don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a permanent riot.
                            And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an
                            insurrection.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I'm here to tell you that a station wagon doesn't <em>quite</em> cut it as a permanent riot
                        abatement tool. For that you need a full sized minivan.</p>
                    <p>I'm <a href="https://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/cars/sienna">with Philip Greenspun</a>.
                        Like black socks and sandals, minivans are actually … <em>kind of awesome?</em> Don't believe
                        all the SUV propaganda. Minivans are flat out superior vehicle command centers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUG3Z8Hxa5I">Swagger wagons</a>, really.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/a-team-van.jpg" alt="a-team-van"></p>
                    <p>The A-Team <a href="https://starcars.fandom.com/wiki/The_A-Team_Van">drove a <em>van</em></a>,
                        not a freakin' SUV. I rest my case.</p>
                    <p>After 7 years, the station wagon had to go. We initially looked at hybrids because, well, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Oh-so-pious-Prius-drivers-Smugness-drifts-2581016.php">isn't
                            that required in California at this point?</a>
                        But if you know me at all, you know I'm a boil the sea kinda guy at
                        heart. I figure if you're going to flirt with partially electric cars,
                        why not put aside these half measures and go all the way?</p>
                    <p>Do you remember that <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s">rapturous 2014 Oatmeal
                            comic about the Tesla Model S</a>? Even for a person who has basically zero interest in
                        automobiles, it did sound <em>really cool</em>.</p>

                    <p>It's been 5 years, but from time to time I'd see some electric vehicle on the road and I'd think
                        about that <strong>Intergalactic SpaceBoat of Light and Wonder</strong>.
                        Maybe it's time for our family to jump on the electric car trend, too,
                        and just late enough that we can avoid the bleeding edge and end up
                        merely on the … <em>leading</em> edge?</p>
                    <p>That's why we're now the proud owners of a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/">fully

                    <p>I've somehow gone from being a person who basically doesn't care about cars at all … to being
                        <strong>one of those insufferable electric car people who won't shut up about them</strong>. I
                        apologize in advance. If you suddenly feel an overwhelming urge to close this browser tab, I
                        don't blame you.</p>
                    <p>I was expecting another car, like the three we bought before. What I got, instead, was a
                        transformation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Yes, yes, electric cars are clean, but it's a revelation how clean <em>everything</em>
                                is in an electric. You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based
                                cars are in daily operation – the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the
                                brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that
                                descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time
                                you use the gas station pumps. You don't fully appreciate how oppressive
                                those little dirty details were until they're gone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in
                                2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for
                                safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars <em>feel</em>
                                like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There's virtually no
                                delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and

                            <p>Electric cars aren't just <em>electric</em>, they're utterly digital
                                to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar
                                Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few
                                digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric
                                car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday
                                digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am
                                a programmer, I'm a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric
                                cars are part of <em>my</em> world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which
                                means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An
                                internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which
                                require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a
                                complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas
                                powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose
                                electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct
                                drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply
                                appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but
                                computers, not so much).</p>

                            <p>Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical
                                transformation of all. Your house is now a "gas station". Our Kia Niro
                                has a range of about <strong>250 miles</strong> on a full battery. With
                                any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day
                                round trip (who even drives this much?), it's very unlikely you'll ever
                                need to "fill the tank" anywhere but at home. Ever. It's so strange to
                                think that in 50 years, gas stations <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php">may
                                    eventually be as odd to see in public as telephone booths now are</a>.
                                Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since
                                that's where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger
                                installed, it literally <em>looks</em> like a gas pump on the side of the house, except
                                this one "pumps" … electrons.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This electric car is such a great experience. It's so much better
                        than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully
                        electric minivan (there isn't) I would literally sell our Honda minivan <em>tomorrow</em> and
                        switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months
                        ago. The electric car is <em>that much better</em>.</p>
                    <p>I was expecting "yet another car", but what I got instead was a new,
                        radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid
                        fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more
                        viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel …
                        deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience
                        that you begin to wonder: why did we <em>ever</em> do it that way?</p>
                    <p>Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/"><em>obsolete</em>.</a></p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/"><img src="index_files/ev-sales.jpg" alt="ev-sales"></a></p>
                    <p>How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly?
                        When exactly did electric cars go from "expensive, experimental thing
                        for crazy people" to "By God, I'll never buy another old fashioned
                        gasoline based car if I can help it"?</p>
                    <p>I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one
                        coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I
                        ignored it all because, like I said, <em>I'm not a car guy</em>. I needed to do the research to
                        understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F">Who Killed the Electric
                            Car?</a></p>
                    <p>This is mostly about the original highly experimental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1">General Motors EV1</a>
                        from 1996 to 1999. It's so early the first models had lead-acid
                        batteries! 😱 There's a number of conspiracy theories floated in the
                        video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the
                        title is straight up <em>price</em>. The battery tech was nowhere near
                        ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the
                        car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was
                        much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners
                        (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same
                        conversion myself, I empathize!</p>
                    <p>I then watched the sequel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car">Revenge of the Electric
                            Car</a>. This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we
                        have today.</p>
                    <p>This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf">Nissan Leaf</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt">Chevy Volt</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)">Tesla Roadster</a>
                        from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in
                        play – that's when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of
                        these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in
                        volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and
                        external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the
                        Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still
                        technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge
                        the battery.</p>
                    <p>Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our
                        Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax
                        incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It's not
                        as cheap as it needs to be … yet. But it's getting there. And it's <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/">already
                            competitive with gasoline vehicles in 2019</a>.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/2019-civic-vs-leaf-1.jpg" alt="2019-civic-vs-leaf-1"></p>
                    <p>It's still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I'm here to tell you that right now, today,
                        I'd buy <em>any</em> modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.</p>
                    <p>If you too are intrigued by the idea of owning an electric car, <em>you should be</em>.
                        It's freaking awesome! Bring your skepticism, as always; I highly
                        recommend the above Matt Ferrell explainer video on electric vehicle
                        myths.</p>
                    <p>As for me, I have seen the future, and it is absolutely, inexorably, and unavoidably … electric.

                        But it's also true that the web has changed a lot in the last 10 years,
                        much less the last 20 or 30.</p>

                        bloat, per se. <strong>The bad guy is <em>advertising</em></strong>. Unlimited, unfettered ad
                        "tech" has creeped into everything and subsumed the web.</p>
                    <p>Personally I don't even want to run ad blockers, and I didn't for a
                        long time – but it's increasingly difficult to avoid running an ad
                        blocker unless you want a clunky, substandard web experience. There's a <em>reason</em> the most
                        popular browser plugins are inevitably ad blockers, isn't there? Just ask Google:</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/chrome-best-extensions-google-search.png" alt="chrome-best-extensions-google-search"></p>
                    <p>So it's all the more surprising to learn that Google is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/">suddenly
                            clamping down hard on adblockers in Chrome</a>. Here's what the author of uBlock Origin, an
                        ad blocking plugin for Chrome, <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417">has
                            to say</a> about today's announcement:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In order for Google Chrome to reach its current user base, it had to
                            support content blockers — these are the top most popular extensions for
                            any browser. Google strategy has been to find the optimal point between
                            the two goals of growing the user base of Google Chrome and preventing
                            content blockers from harming its business.</p>
                        <p>The blocking ability of the webRequest API caused Google to yield
                            control of content blocking to content blockers. Now that Google Chrome
                            is the dominant browser, it is in a better position to shift the optimal
                            point between the two goals which benefits Google's primary business.</p>
                        <p>The deprecation of the blocking ability of the webRequest API is to
                            gain back this control, and to further instrument and report how web

                    <p>The ad blockers themselves are arguably just as complicit. Eye/o GmbH owns <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock</a> and <a href="https://www.ublock.org/">uBlock</a>, employs 150 people, and in 2016 they had 50
                        million euros in revenue, of which about 50% was profit. Google's <a href="https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000092027-why-does-adblock-allow-non-intrusive-ads-">paid
                            "Acceptable Ads" program</a> is a way to funnel money into adblockers to, uh,
                        <em>encourage</em> them to display certain ads. With money. Lots … and lots … of money. 🤑</p>
                    <p>We simultaneously have a very real web obesity crisis, and a looming
                        crackdown on ad blockers, seemingly the only viable weight loss program
                        for websites. What's a poor web citizen to do? Well, there is one thing
                        you can do to escape the need for browser-based adblockers, at least on
                        your home network. Install and configure <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>.</p>

                    <p>I've talked about the amazing Raspberry Pi before <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-raspberry-pi-has-revolutionized-emulation/">in the
                            context of classic game emulation</a>, but this is another brilliant use for a Pi.</p>
                    <p>Here's why it's so cool. If you disable the DHCP server on your router, and let the Pi-Hole
                        become your primary DHCP server, <strong>you get automatic DNS based blocking of ads for every
                            single device on your network</strong>. It's kind of scary how powerful DNS can be, isn't
                        it?</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/pi-hole-action-shot.jpg" alt="pi-hole-action-shot"></p>
                    <p>My Pi-Hole took me about 1 hour to set up, start to finish. All you need is</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BC7BMHY/?tag=codihorr-20">Raspberry Pi 3b+ kit</a>
                            $59</li>
                        <li>a quality <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WR4IJBE/?tag=codihorr-20">32GB SD card</a>
                            $9</li>
                        <li>an ethernet cable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I do recommend the 3b+ because it has <a href="https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/networking">native gigabit ethernet</a> and
                        a bit more muscle. But <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/what-model-raspberry-pi-should-i-use-for-pi-hole/9635">literally
                            any Raspberry Pi</a> you can find laying around will work, though I'd <em>strongly</em>
                        advise you to pick one with a wired ethernet port since it'll be your DNS server.</p>
                    <p>I'm not going to write a whole Pi-Hole installation guide, because there are <a href="https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/pi-hole-tutorial-whole-home-ad-blocking/">lots of
                            great ones</a>
                        out there already. It's not difficult, and there's a slick web GUI
                        waiting for you once you complete initial setup. For your initial
                        testing, pick any IP address you like on your network that won't
                        conflict with anything active. Once you're happy with the basic setup
                        and web interface:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turn OFF your router's DHCP server – existing leases will continue to work, so nothing will
                            be immediately broken.</li>
                        <li>Turn ON the pi-hole DHCP server, in the web GUI.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><img src="index_files/pi-hole-dhcp-server.png" alt="pi-hole-dhcp-server"></p>
                    <p>Once you do this, all your network devices will start to grab their DHCP leases from your
                        Pi-Hole, which will <em>also</em> tell them to route all their DNS requests through the Pi-Hole,
                        and that's when the ✨ magic ✨ happens!</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/pi-hole-blacklists.png" alt="pi-hole-blacklists"></p>
                    <p>All those DNS requests from all the devices on your network will be
                        checked against the ad blacklists; anything matching is quickly and
                        silently discarded <strong>before it ever reaches your browser.</strong></p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/pi-hole-dashboard-stats.png" alt="pi-hole-dashboard-stats"></p>
                    <p>(The Pi-Hole also acts as a <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/will-pi-hole-slow-down-my-network/2048">caching DNS
                            server</a>, so repeated DNS requests will be serviced rapidly from your local network, too.)
                    </p>
                    <p>If you're worried about stability or reliability, you can easily add a
                        cheap battery backed USB plug, or even a second backup Pi-Hole as your
                        secondary DNS provider if you prefer belt and suspenders protection.
                        Switching back to plain boring old vanilla DNS is as easy as unplugging
                        the Pi and flicking the DHCP server setting in your router back on.</p>
                    <p>At this point if you're interested (and you should be!), just give it
                        a try. If you're looking for more information, the project has an <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/">excellent forum</a> full of FAQs and roadmaps.</p>

                            favorite upcoming features!</a></p>
                    <p>I avoided the Pi-Hole project for a while because I didn't need it,
                        and I'd honestly rather jump in later when things are more mature.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/pi-hole-pin.jpg" alt="pi-hole-pin"></p>
                    <p>With the latest Chrome crackdown on ad blockers, now is the time, and I'm impressed how simple
                        and easy <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>
                        is to run. Just find a quiet place to plug it in, spend an hour
                        configuring it, and promptly proceed to forget about it forever as you
                        enjoy a lifetime subscription to <em>a glorious web ad instant weight loss program across every

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
                    <p>When we started <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a> in 2013, our server requirements
                        were high:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1GB RAM</li>
                        <li>modern, fast dual core CPU</li>
                        <li>speedy solid state drive with 20+ GB</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'm not talking about a cheapo shared cpanel server, either, I mean a <em>dedicated</em> virtual
                        private server with those specifications.</p>
                    <p>We were OK with that, because we were <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-ruby/">building
                            in Ruby</a>
                        for the next decade of the Internet. I predicted early on that the cost
                        of renting a suitable VPS would drop to $5 per month, and courtesy of
                        Digital Ocean that indeed <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/new-digital-ocean-pricing-spoiler-5-for-a-1gb-droplet/78230">happened
                            in January 2018</a>.</p>
                    <p>The cloud got cheaper, and faster. Not really a surprise, since <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-hardware-is-free-power-is-expensive/">the price of
                            hardware trends to zero over time</a>. But it's still the cloud, and that means it isn't
                        exactly <em>cheap</em>. It is, after all, someone else's computer that you pay for the privilege
                        of renting.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/there-is-no-cloud.png" alt="there-is-no-cloud"></p>
                    <p>But wait … <strong>what if you could put your <em>own</em> computer "in the cloud"?</strong></p>
                    <p>Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? Reliable connectivity,
                        plus a nice low monthly price for extremely fast hardware? If this
                        sounds crazy, it shouldn't – Mac users have been doing this <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/pricing/colo">for years now</a>.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/mac-colocation-2019-1.png" alt="mac-colocation-2019-1"></p>
                    <p>I suppose it's understandable that Mac users would be on the cutting edge here since Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve#Intel_Xserve">barely makes server hardware</a>,
                        whereas the PC world has always been <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/building-a-computer-the-google-way/">the literal
                            de-facto standard for server hardware</a>.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/mac-stadium-colocation.jpg" alt="mac-stadium-colocation"></p>
                    <p>Given the prevalence and maturity of cloud providers, it's even a <em>little</em> controversial
                        these days to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/building-servers-for-fun-and-prof-ok-maybe-just-for-fun/">colocate
                            actual servers</a>. We've also experimented with <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-scooter-computer/">colocating mini-pcs</a> in
                        various hosting roles. I'm still curious why there isn't more of a cottage industry for
                        colocating mini PCs. Because … <em>I think there should be</em>.</p>
                    <p>I originally wrote about <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-scooter-computer/">the
                            scooter computers</a> we added to our Discourse infrastructure in 2016, plus my own
                        colocation experiment that ran concurrently. <strong>Over the last three years of both
                            experiments, I've concluded that these little boxes are plenty reliable</strong>,
                        with one role specific caveat that I'll explain in the comments. I
                        remain an unabashed fan of mini-PC colocation. I like it so much I put
                        together a new 2019 iteration:</p>

                        see it in my pictures because I physically removed both.</p>

                    <p>Power consumption could be a concern, as the 2017 version had a much
                        lower 15 watt TDP, compared to the 45 watts of this version. That 3×
                        increase in core count ain't free! So I tested that, too, with a
                        combination of <code>i7z</code>, <code>stress</code>, and my handy dandy <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-estimate-when-you-can-measure/">watt meter</a>.</p>

                    <p>I'd expect around 10 - 20 watts doing typical low-load stuff that
                        isn't super CPU intensive. Note that running current-ish versions of <code>mprime</code> jacks
                        power consumption up to 75w 🔥 and the overall clock scales down to 3.1 Ghz … let me tell you,
                        I've learned to be <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-dangers-of-intels-frequency-scaling/">very,
                            <em>very</em> afraid of AVX2 extensions</a>.</p>
                    <p>(If you're worried about noise, don't be. This active cooling
                        solution is clearly overkill for a 65w load, because it barely spun up
                        at all even under full core load. It was <em>extremely</em> quiet.)</p>
                    <p>So we're happy that this machine is a slammin' deal for $820, it's
                        super fast, and plenty reliable. But how about colocation costs? My
                        colocation provider is <a href="https://endoffice.com/">EndOffice</a> out of Boston, and they
                        offer very competitive rates to colocate a Mini-PC: $29/month.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://endoffice.com/minicolo.html"><img src="index_files/endoffice-mini-pc-colocation.png" alt="endoffice-mini-pc-colocation"></a></p>
                    <p>I personally colocate three Mini-PCs for redundancy and just-in-case;
                        there are discounts for colocating more than one. Here they are racked
                        up and in action. Of course I labelled the front and rear before
                        shipping because that's how I roll.</p>
                    <p><img src="index_files/endoffice-colocated-2019-mini-pcs.jpg" alt="endoffice-colocated-2019-mini-pcs"></p>
                    <p>Let's break this down and see what the actual costs of colocating a
                        Mini-PC are versus the cloud. Given the plateauing of CPU speeds, I
                        think five years of useful life for these boxes is realistic, but let's
                        assume a conservative three year lifespan to be safe.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$880 mini-pc 32GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 500GB SSD</li>
                        <li>$120 taxes / shipping / misc</li>
                        <li>$29 × 12 × 3 = $1,044</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's <strong>$2,044 for three years of hosting</strong>. How can we do on Digital Ocean? Per <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/">their current pricing page</a>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 640GB SSD</li>
                        <li>$160/month</li>
                        <li>$160 × 12 × 3 = <strong>$5,760</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This isn't <em>quite</em> apples to apples, as we are getting an
                        extra 140GB of disk and 2 bonus CPUs, but those CPUs are both slower and
                        partially consumed by multi-tenancy compared to our brand new
                        dedicated, isolated CPUs. (I was curious about this, so I just spun up a
                        new $160/month DO instance for a quick test. The <code>sysbench</code> results are 4086 and
                        11760 respectively, considerably below the 2019 Mini-PC results, above.) As you can see,
                        <strong>you pay almost three times as much for a cloud server.</strong> 🤑</p>
                    <p>I'm not saying this is for everyone. If you just need to spin up a
                        quick server or two for testing and experimentation, there's absolutely
                        no way you need to go to the trouble and up-front cost of building and
                        then racking colocated mini-pcs. There's no denying that spinning
                        servers up in the cloud offers unparalleled flexibility and redundancy.
                        But if you do have need for <strong>dedicated computing resources over a period of
                            years</strong>, then building your own small personal cloud, with machines <em>you actually
                            own</em>, is not only one third the cost but also … kinda cool?</p>
